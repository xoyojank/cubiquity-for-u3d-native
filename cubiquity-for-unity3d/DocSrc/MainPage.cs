 * Congratulations! If you are reading this user manual then you have discovered %Cubiquity for Unity3D, and are about to take a step into the exciting world of voxels. Over the coming pages we will show you how voxel-based worlds can enhance your games or virtual environments, and make sure you have the knowledge required to use %Cubiquity for Unity3D to its maximum potential. You can start by reading one of the sections listed below.

 * We can't blame you for wanting to get started quickly, and often the best way to learn is by experimentation. This section will just give you the basic knowledge you need to create your first voxel environments. You can then read other sections of this manual when you want more details of a specific topic. \ref pageQuickStart "Read more..."

 * To make the most of %Cubiquity for Unity3D you will want an understanding of the different components of the system and how they fit together. This section provides a discussion of the key concepts behind %Cubiquity for Unity3D and presents the different classes you will be working with. A good understanding of this section will be important to make effective use of our system, particularly if you want to make a lot of use of it from code. \ref pagePrinciples "Read more..."

 * \subpage pageUserInterface
 * \par
 * The easiest way to get started making voxel environments is to use the built-in editing tools. These are embedded within the Unity3D editor, and they let you directly manipulate your worlds though the scene view. You can create worlds, edit them, and set rendering or physical properties. In this section of the user manual we take you though all the tools which are at your disposal and give tips for getting the most out of them. \ref pageUserInterface "Read more..."

 * \par
 * %Cubiquity for Unity3D provides a clean and elegant API for working with volumes. You can use this API to create volumes procedurally or import them from external sources, modify your volumes in response to in-game events (such as explosions), or implement custom editing tools for your players to use. This section describes the classes and method which you can use for this purpose <a href="annotated.html"><b>Read more...</b></a>
