/** \page pagePrinciples Main Principles
 *
 * We have worked hard to make both the visual and the programmatic interface to %Cubiquity for Unity3D as simple and intuitive as possible. However, internally it is a powerful and flexible system, and with this comes a certain amount of complexity. A high-level understanding of how the system is works will help you to use it more effectively, particularly when using it from code.
 *
 * Therefore we use this part of the user manual to provide the information which may be relevant to people who wish to push the system as far as possible, or even just those who like some understanding of what is happening behind-the-scenes. We will talk at a high level about the structure of the system, the algorithms which underpin it, and the design decisions we have made for its implementation.
 *
 * Before proceeding to read about these principles we would recommend that you at least work through the \ref pageQuickStart "Quick Start" guide to get a feeling for what the system can do. This will provide you with some useful context when reading about the underlying details.
